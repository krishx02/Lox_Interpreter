# Lox_Interpreter
Building a Lox interpreter in Java. This is being done as I go through the book "Crafting Interpreters".  http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/


Where am I in the book? 
Chapter 2, Scanning.

Things that aren't in the interpreter that I want to implement:
* Modulo

Update as of 5/25/2021: I am putting this project on hold (which i'm honestly really sad about) because of the technologies that I have to work with at my internship. I want to get a headstart so that I don't feel "useless." I know sounds dumb but its just a concern of mine that I won't be able to contribute much to the team and I don't really want that to happen. I guarantee I will start working on this project again sometime in the summer.
